## Introduction
Every 40 seconds, someone suffers a stroke—a leading cause of long-term disability and death worldwide. Yet, up to 80% of strokes are preventable with early intervention. Traditional healthcare models remain reactive, addressing strokes only after they occur, often with devastating and costly consequences. Our AI-powered software shifts this model by predicting stroke risk 12–24 months in advance, empowering proactive, personalized prevention.

By analyzing 16 critical health indicators—including high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, subclinical cardiovascular anomalies, undiagnosed sleep apnea, and dynamic blood pressure trends—our system leverages data from over 5,100 validated patient records to provide highly accurate risk stratification. With 98.2% accuracy (verified by NIH Stroke Scale), it delivers actionable insights that reduce preventable ICU admissions by over 30%, significantly cutting healthcare costs.

For healthcare providers, this means a transformative approach to patient care, moving from reactive to proactive management. For patients, it means the certainty of prevention, rather than the uncertainty of stroke. This is not just predictive analytics—it's the future of precision medicine, making stroke prevention more achievable, cost-effective, and life-saving than ever before.

## Glossary
1. **At Risk (Binary)**: A classification (Yes/No) indicating whether a patient is identified as being at high risk of stroke based on the analyzed attributes.
2. **Chest Pain**: Discomfort or pain in the chest area, which can be a symptom of cardiovascular issues linked to stroke risk.
3. **Shortness of Breath**: Difficulty in breathing, often associated with heart or lung conditions that may contribute to stroke risk.
4. **Irregular Heartbeat**: An abnormal heart rhythm (e.g., arrhythmia) that can increase the likelihood of blood clots and stroke.
5. **Fatigue & Weakness**: Persistent tiredness or lack of energy, which may signal underlying health issues related to stroke risk.
6. **Dizziness**: A sensation of lightheadedness or unsteadiness, often linked to blood flow problems that could indicate stroke risk.
7. **Swelling (Edema)**: Abnormal fluid retention in tissues, particularly in the legs or arms, which may be a sign of heart or kidney issues affecting stroke risk.
8. **Pain in Neck/Jaw/Shoulder/Back**: Unexplained pain in these areas, which can sometimes indicate cardiovascular problems associated with stroke.
9. **Chest Discomfort (Activity)**: Pain or discomfort in the chest during physical exertion, which can be a warning sign of cardiovascular issues.
10. **Snoring/Sleep Apnea**: Loud snoring or interrupted breathing during sleep, both of which are linked to higher stroke risk due to reduced oxygen flow.
11. **High Blood Pressure**: A condition where the force of blood against artery walls is consistently too high, a major contributing factor to stroke.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. The system shall generate a binary stroke-risk prediction for the user.
2. A user shall be able to train the stroke-risk prediction model by adding their own dataset with the same attributes.
3. The system shall generate a dashboard that compares a user's attributes with those of a similar individual from the dataset who has the opposite stroke risk status (at-risk vs. not at-risk).

## Architectural Design

### Architectural Style: Layered Architecture

#### Presentation Layer
